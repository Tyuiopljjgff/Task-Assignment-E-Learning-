The file .env:backend that I have uploaded to the GitHub repository is for the backend, not for the frontend.

1.npm install -g @angular/cli

"Please replace the "src" folder generated after running the npm install -g @angular/cli command with my src folder from GitHub."

npm install

2.ng serve

###**Note: I finished it yesterday on 2/14. It could have been done faster, but I got busy making sure the versions were compatible and syncing them.

###**Note:I carefully transferred the design from Figma exactly as it is, including using the SVG icons and adding them directly into the HTML code. Every detail was handled with attention to keep the design intact.
